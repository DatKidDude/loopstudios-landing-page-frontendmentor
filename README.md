## About The Project

This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Users should be able to:

1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Google Fonts
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid / Flexbox
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

## What I Learned

I learned how to to use Grid to overlay other elements on a webpage. I also learned a few new methods of making a sliding navigation bar. I also used the clamp method for text so that it automatically adjusts without having to use media queries.

## Useful Resources

Figma - Paste the design image inside of figma to check containers, width, etc...

## Acknowledgments
